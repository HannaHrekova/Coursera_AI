## Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ 
My portfolio is currently under active development, including several interesting projects. These include historical stock and income data analysis with dashboard visualization, US real estate sales analysis, data publishing from Watson Studio, and more. With each new module, I add new projects to demonstrate my development in the field.

### Additional:
#### Applied Data Science
This branch contains work related to the Applied Data Science module, including:
- 8 lab projects covering topics like data wrangling, EDA, SQL, interactive dashboards, and machine learning.
- A presentation summarizing the results and insights.
