## Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ 
My portfolio is currently under active development, including several interesting projects. These include historical stock and income data analysis with dashboard visualization, US real estate sales analysis, data publishing from Watson Studio, and more. With each new module, I add new projects to demonstrate my development in the field.

### Additional:

#### 1. Applied Data Science
This project contains work related to the Applied Data Science module, including:
- 8 lab projects covering topics like data wrangling, EDA, SQL, interactive dashboards, and machine learning.
- A presentation summarizing the results and insights.

#### 2. Building a Regression Model in Keras
The project consists of four tasks, each completed in a separate Jupiter Notebook.

#### 3. AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning
This project consists of various tasks related to deep learning, data loading, and model training using PyTorch and pretrained models. 
Some tasks were completed in skillsnetwork environment, and others in Google Colab.

#### 4. Alfred â€” AI Multi-Tool Assistant (LangGraph Agent)

Alfred is an AI assistant built using LangGraph and the CohereLabs/c4ai-command-r-v01 model.
It combines multiple tools (web search, weather, guest info, etc.) and supports conversational memory.
The agent was developed as part of the Hugging Face Agents Course and deployed with Gradio on Hugging Face Spaces.
